## Bootloader

## Required Packages

- `bochs`
- `bochs-x`
- `nasm`

## Ensure your environment is set up:

Follow [this tutorial](https://www.joe-bergeron.com/posts/Writing%20a%20Tiny%20x86%20Bootloader/) by Joe Bergeron (thank you Joe) if you want to follow along, or you can use the code in this repository. Just clone this repo, `cd` into bootloader, and follow the steps after the code in the tutorial to compile boot.asm to boot.com and run with bochs. If you see a debug window that allows you to press continue, do so, and you should see "Hello World!" on the bochs window!
